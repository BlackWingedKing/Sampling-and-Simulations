# Sampling-and-Simulations

Simulation exercise of the course EE-325 probability and random processes

We have 

1. Generated Bernoulli and exponential distributions using Inversion and Rejection sampling techniques

2. Generated the Normal distn using box-mueller method

3. Implemented a discrete-time Kalman Filter (Yes it works :) )

4. Simulated a queue-system and observed Little's law
